# jLox-funtime
The java interpreter for jLox from Bob Nystrom's book at http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

## Motivation

Hey y'all! I'm on spring break and Mr. Nystrom has kindley released another chapter of his book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), 
so I have decied to start working on typing it out myself and adding notes where I see fit. I just really like learning about
languages, and that's, OK. 

This may be incomplete for a little while, as the book is being released one chapter at a time. In the mean-time, I might work on 
the Kaleidescope compiler [tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) from LLVM.
