# jLox-funtime
The java interpreter for jLox from Bob Nystrom's book at http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/

## Motivation

Hey y'all! I'm on spring break and Mr. Nystrom has kindley released another chapter of his book [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), 
so I have decied to start typing it out myself and adding notes where I see fit. Mr Nystrom has left the implementation thin in a few places so I'll try to
point out those areas and try to come back and flesh them out. 

This may be incomplete for a little while, as the book is being released one chapter at a time. In the mean-time, I might work on 
the Kaleidescope compiler [tutorial](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) from LLVM.
